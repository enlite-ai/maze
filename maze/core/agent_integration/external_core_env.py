    Designed to be run on a separate thread, alongside the agent integration running on the main thread.

    Hence, the control flow is: External env (like a Unity env) controlling the agent integration object,
    which in turn controls this external core env, which controls the execution of rollout loop by suspending it
    until the next state is available from the agent integration object.

    Wrappers of this env and the agents acting on top of it see it as ordinary CoreEnv, but no actual
    logic happens here -- instead, states and associated info are obtained from the agent integration
    running on the main thread, and executions produced by the agents are passed back to the agent integration.

    During the step function, the execution of this thread is suspended while waiting for the next state
    from the agent integration.
