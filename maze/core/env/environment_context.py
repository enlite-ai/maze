"""The environment context provides services that are globally available to all objects of the interaction loop.

The context is owned by the :obj:`~maze.core.core_env.CoreEnv`. Maintaining the global services in a separate object has
several benefits

- We avoid scattering references to the core env in all kinds of objects, which could easily result in unexpected
  behaviour.
- In scenarios with multiple instantiated agent-environment interaction loops the context can be used to identify
  the parent environments.

    This class keeps track of services that can be employed by all objects of the agent-environment loop.

    Currently the context is populated by

    - Event service: Acts as backend of the PubSub service, collects all events from the env.
      The event service can also be directly facilitated by components outside the environment (e.g. agent, heuristics,
      state/observation mapping)
    - Episode ID: Generates and keeps track of the current episode ID
      Episode IDs are used for connecting logged statistics, events and recorded trajectory data together, making
      analysis and drill-down across these different levels possible.
    - Step ID: Tracks ID of the core env step we are currently in. Helps wrappers recognize core env steps in multi-step
      scenarios.
