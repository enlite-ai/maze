    """Interface for environments with sub-step structure, which is generally enough to cover multi-step,
    hierarchical and multi-agent environments.

    This environment can continuously create and destroy a previously unknown,
    unlimited number of actors during the course of an episode. Every actor is associated with one of the
    available policies.

    The lifecycle of the environment is decoupled from the lifecycle of the actors. The interaction loop should
    continue, until the environment as a whole is set to done, which is returned as usual by the step() function.
    Individual actors might end earlier, which can be queried by the is_actor_done() method.

    Pseudo-code of the interaction loop:

    # start a new episode
    observation = env.reset()

    while not done:
        # find out which actor is next to act (dictated by the env)
        sub_step_key, actor_id = env.actor_id()

        # obtain the next action from the policy
        action = sample_from_policy(observation, sub_step_key, actor_id)

        # step the env
        observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)

        # optionally use is_actor_done() to find out if the actor was terminated (relevant during training)

        constant per convention and :meth:`actor_id` can be called arbitrarily.
