Proxy keyword arguments don't reflect top-level properties of the underlying configuration, but act as shortcuts to 
subcomponents of top-level attributes (e.g.: "policy" is not a top-level attribute in training mode, but is 
shorthand for model.policy). Since they are more specific than potentially specified top-level arguments, they 
replace their equivalents in higher-level attributes. I.e.: If "model" and "policy" are specified, the "policy" 
value replaces the existing "model.policy".
Furthermore, a configuration attribute might refer to a configuration node that is not identical with the attribute. 
E.g: "critic" is a top-level attribute, but loads content for model.critic - i.e. the proxy is resolved automatically by 
Hydra, if a configuration module is loaded. This is marked explicitly, since we don't have (and want) to process this.
