    "This notebook describes and explains the basic workflow for training an existing OpenAI Gym environment (specifically: `CartPole-v0`), rolling out the trained policy and evaluating it. It is part of the *Getting Started* series aiming to convey the basics of Maze and hence targeted at first-time users. You are not expected to have any prior experience with Maze (although basic knowledge of reinforcement learning concepts is recommended)."
