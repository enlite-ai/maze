    "## Writing a Customized Wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "[Part 2](https://colab.research.google.com/github/enlite-ai/maze/blob/master/tutorials/notebooks/getting_started/getting_started_2.ipynb) introduced the concept of environment wrappers - here we take a look at how to write one ourselves. Wrappers can be immensely useful, as they allow to modify an environment's behaviour without having to rewrite the actual environment code and can be nested arbitrarily. They thus enable a high degree of flexibility in configuration your RL setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example for this is _reward clipping_, which is a particular kind of reward shaping. In reward clipping, an environment's rewards are clipped to a specific range. This may be done e.g. to standardize the reward range across several environments, or if rewards don't carry much information outside a certain range. Standardized rewards may also be helpful in learning an appropriate policy. Note that there are other approaches to circumvent these problems, e.g. reward normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any wrapper in Maze inherits from `maze.core.wrappers.wrapper.Wrapper`. This ensures that wrapped environments provide all the functionality needed to fit into the framework. For our minimal reward clipping wrapper, only changing the reward in `.step()` is of immediate interest - we don't care about changing any other behaviour. We can let our reward clipping wrapper thus inherit from `maze.core.wrappers.wrapper.RewardWrapper`, which already takes care of most of the functionality to be implemented in a wrapper.\n",

    "Our minimal reward clipping wrapper could look like this:"
