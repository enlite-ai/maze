Training with Events and KPIs

Hydra Configuration
-------------------

The entire structure of this example is identical to the one on :ref:`training the MazeEnv <train_maze_env>`.
Everything regarding the event systems was already changed in the
:ref:`section on adding events and KPIs  <env_from_scratch-events>`
and the trainers will consider these changes implicitly.

Training an Agent
-----------------

To retrain the agent on the environment extended with event and KPI logging, run:

.. code:: bash

    maze-run -cn conf_train env=tutorial_cutting_2d_events wrappers=tutorial_cutting_2d_events \
    model=tutorial_cutting_2d_events algorithm=ppo

Running the trainer should print an extended command line output similar to the one shown below.
In addition to base events we now also get a statistics log of *CuttingEvents*, *InventoryEvents* and KPIs.

.. code:: bash

Of course these changes are also reflected in the :ref:`Tensorboard log <logging>`
which you can again view with your browser at http://localhost:6006/.

.. code:: bash

    tensorboard --logdir outputs

As you can see we now have the two additional sections *train_CuttingEvents* and *train_InventoryEvents* available.

A closer look at these events reveals that the agent actually starts to learn something meaning full as
the number of invalid cuts decreases which of course implies that the number of valid cuts increases
and we are able to full fill the current customer demand.
