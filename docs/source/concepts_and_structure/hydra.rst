Configuration with Hydra
========================

Here, we explain the configuration scheme of the Maze framework, which
explain how to configure your environment and other
components using YAML files, run your experiments via CLI, and customize
the runs via CLI overrides.

The Maze framework utilizes the `Hydra configuration framework`_. These pages aim to give
you a quick overview of how Maze uses Hydra and what its capabilities are, so that
you can get up to speed quickly without prior Hydra knowledge:
